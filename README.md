# Calculating-Metrics-for-Batched-Data-using-Torch

Calculating Binary Classification Metrics (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1, DCG, NDCG, HR, ARHR) for Batched Data using Torch

- Input: pred -> [B, N], true -> [B, N], where [B, N] denotes a two-dimensional array, with B representing BatchSize and N representing the length of the samples.
- Output: Average metrics per batch.

The latter part of the Jupyter notebook will validate the accuracy of the functions. ï¼š)
